# Median App

This directory contains the stub setup for migrating our application to Median.

## Overview

Import `@catalyft/core` here and rebuild UI in Median.

This is a placeholder directory for the upcoming Median project that will leverage our existing core functionality while providing a new mobile-focused user interface.

## Setup Instructions

To get started with the Median app:

1. Navigate to the median-app directory:
   ```bash
   cd median-app
   ```

2. Initialize Median:
   ```bash
   npx median init
   ```

3. Install the core package:
   ```bash
   npm install @catalyft/core
   ```

## Next Steps

- The core functionality is available through `@catalyft/core`
- Implement the UI components using Median's framework
- Leverage the existing API and business logic from the core package

## Notes

This is currently just scaffolding - no functional code has been implemented yet.
