# E2E Testing Status - Updated

## Latest Update: August 8, 2025

### âœ… Recent Fixes Applied

**Problem**: GitHub Actions E2E tests were failing on both iOS and Android during smoke tests.

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. **Text Matching Issues**: Tests were looking for `'Catalyft'` but the actual app displays `'CataLyft'`
2. **Timeout Issues**: Tests were using synchronous expects instead of `waitFor` with proper timeouts
3. **App Launch Issues**: Tests weren't consistently launching fresh app instances

**Fixes Applied**:

1. **Fixed Text Matching** (`mobile/e2e/smoke.e2e.ts`, `mobile/e2e/basic.e2e.ts`):
   - Changed from `by.text('Catalyft')` to `by.text('CataLyft')` to match actual app text
   - Verified the app displays "CataLyft" in the main title

2. **Added Proper Timeouts**:
   - Replaced synchronous `expect()` calls with `waitFor().withTimeout()`
   - Set longer timeouts (10-15 seconds) for CI environments
   - Increased Jest setup timeout from 120s to 180s in `.detoxrc.js`

3. **Improved App Launch**:
   - Added `newInstance: true` to `device.launchApp()` calls
   - More reliable app state for each test

4. **Added Robust Fallback Tests**:
   - Test for `appContainer` testID existence
   - Basic interaction tests to ensure app doesn't crash
   - Tests that work even if specific UI elements change

### Current Status

**Last Workflow Run**: #89 (FAILED)
- **iOS**: Hung during smoke test execution 
- **Android**: Failed smoke test step

**Latest Push**: Commit `2fa9bd98` with fixes
- New workflow run should be triggered automatically
- Expected to resolve both iOS hanging and Android failures

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The workflow is configured to run on:
- Push to `main` and `develop` branches  
- Pull requests to `main`
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Jobs**:
1. **e2e-ios** (macOS-13): Tests iOS app on simulator
2. **e2e-android** (Ubuntu): Tests Android app on emulator  
3. **test-summary**: Aggregates results

### Next Steps

1. **Monitor New Workflow Run**: Check if fixes resolve the smoke test issues
2. **If Tests Pass**: Move to full E2E test suite execution
3. **If Tests Still Fail**: Further debugging of specific CI environment issues

### Test Commands for Local Development

```bash
# Validate setup
npm run detox:validate

# iOS Testing
npm run detox:build:ios
npm run detox:smoke:ios
npm run detox:test:ios

# Android Testing  
npm run detox:build:android
npm run detox:smoke:android
npm run detox:test:android
```

### Files Modified in Latest Fix

- `mobile/e2e/smoke.e2e.ts`: Fixed text matching and added timeouts
- `mobile/e2e/basic.e2e.ts`: Fixed text matching and added robust fallback tests
- `mobile/.detoxrc.js`: Increased Jest setup timeout to 180s

**Expected Result**: Both iOS and Android smoke tests should now pass, allowing the full E2E test suite to run.
