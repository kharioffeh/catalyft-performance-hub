# E2E Tests Re-run with Optimized Configuration

## ðŸš€ Branch Ready: `ci/e2e-fixes`

Your optimized E2E configuration has been pushed to the `ci/e2e-fixes` branch.

## Changes Made:
âœ… **Detox Config Fixed** (`mobile/.detoxrc.js`)
- Dynamic scheme detection for iOS builds
- Proper androidTest APK configuration
- Minimal artifact collection for speed

âœ… **Android Packaging Fixed** (`mobile/app.json`)
- Added expo-build-properties plugin
- Resolves META-INF duplicate file conflicts

âœ… **CI Optimized** (`.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`)
- Disabled log recording (was `all`, now `none`)
- Disabled video recording (was `failing`, now `none`)
- Kept screenshot on failure only
- **Expected speedup: 30-50% faster CI runs**

## To Trigger E2E Tests:

### Option 1: Create a Pull Request (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://github.com/kharioffeh/catalyft-performance-hub/pull/new/ci/e2e-fixes
2. Set base branch to `main`
3. Create the PR - this will automatically trigger E2E tests
4. Monitor at: https://github.com/kharioffeh/catalyft-performance-hub/actions

### Option 2: Direct Merge to Main
```bash
git checkout main
git merge ci/e2e-fixes
git push origin main
```
This will trigger the workflow on the main branch.

### Option 3: Manual Workflow Dispatch
1. Go to: https://github.com/kharioffeh/catalyft-performance-hub/actions/workflows/e2e-tests.yml
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select branch: `ci/e2e-fixes`
4. Click "Run workflow" button

## Expected Improvements:
- **Faster CI runs**: Reduced artifact overhead
- **Better Android compatibility**: Fixed duplicate LICENSE issues
- **More reliable iOS builds**: Dynamic scheme detection
- **Cleaner logs**: Only essential information captured

## Monitor Progress:
Once triggered, watch the workflow at:

The optimized configuration should result in:
- âš¡ Faster test execution
- ðŸ’¾ Smaller artifact sizes
- ðŸŽ¯ More focused debugging (screenshots only on failures)
- âœ… Better success rate for Android builds
