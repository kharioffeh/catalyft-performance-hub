# PR #93 & #94 Closure Summary

## PR #93: "Add testing libraries and dev dependencies"
**Status**: ✅ **ALREADY MERGED**
- Commit `aea6f014` is already in the main branch
- Testing libraries and dependencies have been added
- **Action**: Can be closed as already merged

## PR #94: "test(e2e-android): fix Jest rootDir and add Detox helpers"  
**Status**: ❌ **OUTDATED/SUPERSEDED**
- Proposed changes:
  1. Simplify helpers.ts to just adapter setup
  2. Change Jest rootDir configuration
- Current state:
  - helpers.ts has comprehensive E2EHelpers class (better than PR's simplified version)
  - Jest config works with current rootDir setup
  - PR #95 (already merged) provides better fixes for E2E configuration
- **Action**: Can be closed as superseded by PR #95 and current implementation

## Recommendation: SAFE TO CLOSE BOTH

### Reasons:
1. **PR #93**: Already merged into main (commit exists in main branch)
2. **PR #94**: Superseded by better implementation:
   - Current helpers.ts is more comprehensive
   - PR #95 provided better E2E configuration fixes
   - Jest config is working properly with current setup

### What's Currently Working:
- ✅ Full E2E test suite with comprehensive helpers
- ✅ Jest/TypeScript configuration properly set up
- ✅ PR #95's improvements already merged (better than PR #94)
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow running with latest configuration

## Action Items:
1. Close PR #93 on GitHub (already merged)
2. Close PR #94 on GitHub (superseded by PR #95)
3. Clean up local branches if needed
