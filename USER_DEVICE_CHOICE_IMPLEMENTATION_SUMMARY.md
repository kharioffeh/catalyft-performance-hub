# ✅ User Device Choice System - Implementation Complete

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

The fitness tracking app has been **completely transformed** from an automatic device priority system to a **user-controlled device selection system**. Users now have full control over which device powers their calorie tracking!

---

## 🔄 What Changed

### ❌ **OLD SYSTEM** (Removed)
```
App Automatically Decides:
WHOOP (highest priority) → Apple Watch → Google Fit → Manual
- No user control
- Automatic switching
- Confusing data sources
```

### ✅ **NEW SYSTEM** (Implemented)
```
USER CHOOSES:
User selects preferred device → Only that device used → Manual fallback if no data
- Full user control
- Respects user choice
- Clear data source
```

---

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### 1. 📊 **Database Layer**
- ✅ **New Table**: `user_wearable_preferences` to store user choices
- ✅ **Updated View**: `user_daily_calories` respects user preference instead of auto-priority
- ✅ **Migration Ready**: `20250128030000-user-device-preference.sql`

### 2. 🎣 **Backend Logic**
- ✅ **New Hook**: `useWearablePreferences` for device management
- ✅ **Updated Logic**: Removed automatic priority between wearables
- ✅ **User Choice**: Only selected device data is used

### 3. 🎨 **User Interface**
