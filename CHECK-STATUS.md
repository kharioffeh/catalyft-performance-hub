# 🔍 Quick Status Check Guide

## 📱 Check Your Tests Status

### Option 1: GitHub Website (Recommended)
1. **Visit**: https://github.com/kharioffeh/catalyft-performance-hub
2. **Click**: "Actions" tab at the top
3. **Look for**: Latest "E2E Tests" workflow run
4. **Monitor**: Both iOS and Android job status

### Option 2: From Terminal (Advanced)
```bash
# Check recent commits to see what triggered
git log --oneline -3

# Check remote status
git status

# See what's been pushed
git log --oneline origin/main -5
```

## 🚨 What to Look For

### ✅ **Success Indicators**
- Green checkmarks next to job names
- "All checks have passed" message
- No red error indicators

### ⚠️ **Warning Signs**  
- Yellow dots (still running - be patient)
- Red X marks (failed - we'll fix together)
- Orange warning triangles (partial failures)

### ⏱️ **Timing Expectations**
- **Total Runtime**: 15-30 minutes for both platforms
- **iOS Build**: 8-15 minutes 
- **Android Build**: 10-20 minutes
- **First Run**: May take longer due to caching

## 📞 If You See Issues

**Copy the error message and let me know!** Common patterns:
- `Build failed` → Dependencies issue (quick fix)
- `Emulator failed` → Android setup issue (known solutions)
- `Test failed` → App logic issue (expected on first run)
- `Timeout` → Infrastructure issue (retry usually works)

## 🎯 Next Steps After Success

Once tests pass:
1. **Celebrate!** 🎉 You have professional E2E testing
2. **Bookmark** the Actions page for future monitoring  
3. **Share** the success with your team
4. **Plan** next development features knowing tests will catch regressions
