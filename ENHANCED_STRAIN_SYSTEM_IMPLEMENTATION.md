## Overview

This implementation provides a sophisticated strain calculation system that combines real-time heart rate data from wearables with exercise volume and RPE to deliver precise, personalized training load monitoring. The system uses industry-standard TRIMP calculations enhanced with machine learning algorithms for optimal training guidance.

## Architecture Components

- Heart rate variability (HRV) tracking
- Heart rate zone calculation based on reserve percentage
- Real-time data streaming via WebSocket connections
- Automatic device reconnection and error handling

### 2. Enhanced Strain Calculation Engine (`useEnhancedStrainCalculation.ts`)

**Dual-Component Strain Model:**

#### Cardiovascular Strain (0-10 scale)
Uses TRIMP (Training Impulse) methodology:
```typescript
// Heart Rate Zone Multipliers
zone1: 1.0  // 50-60% HRR (Recovery)
zone2: 2.0  // 60-70% HRR (Aerobic)
zone3: 3.0  // 70-80% HRR (Tempo)
zone4: 4.0  // 80-90% HRR (Lactate Threshold)
zone5: 5.0  // 90-100% HRR (VO2 Max)

// TRIMP Calculation
trimp = Î£(timeInZone Ã— zoneMultiplier)
cardiovascularStrain = (trimp Ã— sessionDuration Ã— fitnessMultiplier) / 60
```

#### Mechanical Strain (0-10 scale)
Based on volume load and perceived exertion:
```typescript
totalVolume = Î£(sets Ã— reps Ã— load_kg)
averageRPE = Î£(rpe Ã— sets) / totalSets

volumeStrain = log10(totalVolume + 1) Ã— 0.8
rpeStrain = (averageRPE / 10) Ã— 4

mechanicalStrain = (volumeStrain + rpeStrain) Ã— sessionMultiplier Ã— fitnessMultiplier
```

#### Overall Strain (0-21 scale)
Session-type weighted combination:
```typescript
// Weighting by Session Type
strength:     30% CV + 70% Mechanical
conditioning: 70% CV + 30% Mechanical  
hypertrophy:  40% CV + 60% Mechanical
recovery:     80% CV + 20% Mechanical
technical:    20% CV + 80% Mechanical

overallStrain = (cvStrain Ã— cvWeight + mechStrain Ã— mechWeight) Ã— 2.1
```

### 3. Real-time Monitoring Dashboard

**Strain Dial Enhancements:**
- Dynamic color zones based on current vs target strain
- Real-time heart rate display with BPM indicator
- Heart rate zone time tracking (5-zone model)
- Strain trajectory prediction based on current pace
- Contextual recommendations for intensity adjustment

**Live Metrics Display:**
- Current heart rate with confidence indicator
- Heart rate reserve percentage
- Time spent in each training zone
- Average session heart rate
- Cardiovascular vs mechanical strain breakdown
- Real-time strain efficiency (strain per minute)

### 4. Intelligent Recommendations Engine

**Context-Aware Guidance:**
- Zone-specific training recommendations
- Heart rate-based intensity adjustments
- Volume modification suggestions based on strain trajectory
- Recovery recommendations based on HRV trends
- Session completion predictions

**Examples:**
```typescript
// High HR Zone (>90% HRR)
"Heart rate very high - consider longer rest periods"

// Low Strain for Conditioning
"Heart rate low for conditioning - increase pace or intensity"

// Optimal Zone Achievement
"Great! You're in the optimal strain zone for this session"

// Volume Adjustment
"Consider reducing intensity or volume to hit target zone"
```

## Advanced Features

### 1. Biometric Profile Integration

**Personalization Parameters:**
```typescript
interface BiometricProfile {
  restingHeartRate: number;    // Measured or calculated
  maxHeartRate: number;        // Age-predicted or tested
  age: number;                 // For HR calculations
  fitness_level: string;       // Strain multiplier adjustment
  hrv_baseline?: number;       // Recovery baseline
}
```

**Fitness Level Adjustments:**
- **Elite**: 0.5-0.6x strain multiplier (higher tolerance)
- **Advanced**: 0.7-0.8x strain multiplier
- **Intermediate**: 1.0x strain multiplier (baseline)
- **Beginner**: 1.3-1.4x strain multiplier (lower tolerance)

### 2. Heart Rate Reserve Calculation

Accurate zone targeting using Karvonen formula:
```typescript
heartRateReserve = maxHeartRate - restingHeartRate
targetHeartRate = ((targetIntensity / 100) Ã— heartRateReserve) + restingHeartRate
heartRateReservePercent = ((currentHR - restingHR) / heartRateReserve) Ã— 100
```
