# Apple Watch / HealthKit Integration Setup Guide

## üì± Prerequisites

- macOS development machine
- Xcode 14.0 or later
- Physical iPhone (iOS 13.0+)
- Apple Developer Account (for device testing)
- Apple Watch (optional but recommended)

## üöÄ Quick Setup

Run the automated setup script:

```bash
cd /workspace/mobile
chmod +x scripts/setup-healthkit.sh
./scripts/setup-healthkit.sh
```

## üìã Manual Setup Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd /workspace/mobile
npm install react-native-health --save --legacy-peer-deps
npm install react-native-permissions --save --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 2. iOS Configuration

```bash
cd ios
pod install
```

### 3. Configure Xcode Project

1. Open `/workspace/mobile/ios/Catalyft.xcworkspace` in Xcode
2. Select the Catalyft project in the navigator
3. Go to **Signing & Capabilities** tab
4. Click **+ Capability**
5. Add **HealthKit** capability
6. Enable these options:
   - ‚úÖ Background Delivery
   - ‚úÖ Clinical Health Records (optional)

### 4. Configure App Entitlements

The entitlements file should be automatically created at `ios/Catalyft/Catalyft.entitlements`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>com.apple.developer.healthkit</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.developer.healthkit.access</key>
    <array>
        <string>health-records</string>
    </array>
    <key>com.apple.developer.healthkit.background-delivery</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

### 5. Update Info.plist

Ensure these keys are in `ios/Catalyft/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSHealthShareUsageDescription</key>
<string>Catalyft needs access to read your health data to sync workouts, heart rate, sleep, and recovery metrics from your Apple Watch and other health devices.</string>
<key>NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription</key>
<string>Catalyft needs permission to save your workouts and fitness data to Apple Health so it syncs with your Apple Watch and other health apps.</string>
```
