## 🚀 Build Status

**PR:** https://github.com/kharioffeh/catalyft-performance-hub/pull/[PR_NUMBER]
**Branch:** agent-11-design-system
**Commit:** 7bd67429

## ⏱️ Expected Results

| Metric | Before | After (Expected) |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Build Time | 30+ min (timeout) | 10-15 minutes |
| Memory Usage | 2-4GB | <1GB |
| Architecture Count | 4 | 1 |
| Dependencies | ~90 | ~80 |

## 📊 What to Monitor

1. **GitHub Actions Tab**: Watch the Android build job
2. **Expected Timeline**:
   - 0-2 min: Setup and dependencies
   - 2-5 min: Expo prebuild
   - 5-12 min: Gradle build
   - 12-15 min: APK upload

## 🔄 Next Steps

### If Build Succeeds ✅
1. Merge the PR
2. Gradually re-add dependencies one by one
3. Test each addition in separate PRs

### If Build Still Fails ❌
1. Check the specific error in GitHub Actions logs
2. Consider using EAS Build instead
3. Or skip Android CI temporarily with:
   ```yaml
   android-build:
     if: false  # Skip Android
   ```

## 🔧 Reverting Changes (if needed)

To restore full functionality later:
```bash
git revert 7bd67429
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

## 📝 Notes

- This is a **temporary fix** for CI/CD only
- The app still has full functionality for iOS builds
- Android builds will work locally with full dependencies
- The design system components are intact but animations disabled

## ✨ Success Indicators

- ✅ No timeout after 30 minutes
- ✅ APK successfully generated
- ✅ All other tests pass (iOS, validation)
- ✅ PR ready to merge
