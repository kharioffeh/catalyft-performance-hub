# Subscription Infrastructure Implementation Summary

## Overview

Built a comprehensive subscription management system that replaces account deletion with a tiered subscription model. Users can cancel their subscription and be moved to a Free tier with limited features, then resubscribe when they want to upgrade back to Pro.

## ‚úÖ **What Was Implemented**

### 1. **Subscription Management Hook** (`src/hooks/useSubscription.ts`)

**Features:**
- Comprehensive subscription state management
- Tier-based feature access control
- Subscription actions (cancel, reactivate, manage)
- Feature limitation system

**Tier System:**
```typescript
Free Tier:
- Basic workout tracking (unlimited basic tracking)
- Basic calendar view
- Community access
- No AI features, wearables, analytics, or nutrition

Pro Tier (¬£9.99/month for UK | $13.99/month international):
- Unlimited workout tracking
- AI-powered chat assistant
- Full analytics & insights
- Nutrition logging & tracking
- Wearable device integration
- Custom training programs
- Advanced progress analytics
- Priority support
```

### 2. **Subscription Manager Component** (`src/components/SubscriptionManager.tsx`)

**Features:**
- Beautiful subscription status display with badges
- Plan comparison and feature lists
- Upgrade/downgrade buttons
- Cancel subscription with confirmation dialog
- Reactivate canceled subscriptions
- Manage billing (Stripe customer portal)
- Trial warnings and expiration notices
- Past due payment handling

**Visual Elements:**
- Status badges (Trial, Active, Canceled, Past Due, Free)
- Tier icons (Crown for Pro, Star for Free)
- Upgrade prompts for free users
- Loading states for all actions

### 3. **Feature Gate System** (`src/components/FeatureGate.tsx`)

**Components:**
- `FeatureGate` - Full-page upgrade prompts for restricted features
- `ProBadge` - Inline badges showing pro-only features
- `useFeatureAccess` - Hook for feature access checks

**Usage Examples:**
```tsx
// Wrap restricted content
<FeatureGate feature="nutritionLogging">
  <NutritionDashboard />
</FeatureGate>

// Check access in components
const { canUseNutrition, canUseAI } = useFeatureAccess();

// Add pro badges
<h2>AI Chat <ProBadge feature="aiChatMessages" /></h2>
```

### 4. **Settings Integration**

**Removed:**
- ‚ùå Delete account functionality

- `reactivate-subscription` - Reactivate canceled subscription
- `create-portal-session` - Open Stripe customer portal for billing management

**Security:**

### 6. **App Protection Updates**

## üîß **Technical Architecture**

### State Management:
```typescript
// Subscription hook provides everything needed
const {
  isPro, isFree, isTrialing, isCanceled,
  canAccess, getLimit, tierFeatures,
  cancelSubscription, reactivateSubscription,
  startCheckout, manageSubscription
} = useSubscription();
```

### Feature Access Control:
```typescript
// Simple feature checks
if (canAccess('nutritionLogging')) {
  // Show nutrition features
} else {
  // Show upgrade prompt
}
```

### Stripe Integration:
- **Checkout** - Updated with geo-based pricing (GBP/USD)
- **Portal** - Customer portal for billing management  
- **Webhooks** - Handle subscription status changes
- **Cancellation** - Cancel at period end (keeps access)
- **Reactivation** - Restore canceled subscription
- **Auto-conversion** - Trial to subscription with currency detection

### Geo-Based Pricing:
```typescript
// Dynamic pricing based on user location
const { currency, symbol, price } = getUserCurrency();
// UK users: ¬£9.99/month | International: $13.99/month

// Usage in components
const tierFeatures = getTierFeatures(); // Returns localized pricing
// UI automatically shows correct currency/price
```

## üìä **Key Metrics to Track**

- Free to paid upgrade rate
- Cancellation to reactivation rate
- Feature gate click-through rates

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

### Immediate:
1. **Deploy Edge Functions** to Supabase
2. **Test subscription flows** in staging

4. **Add feature gates** to existing features

### Future Enhancements:
1. **Usage analytics** - Track feature usage by tier
2. **Smart prompts** - Show upgrades at optimal moments  
3. **Granular limits** - More specific feature restrictions
4. **Referral system** - Free tier users can earn Pro time

## üîí **Security & Compliance**

### Data Protection:
- ‚úÖ **No data deletion** - Users keep their data when downgrading
- ‚úÖ **Privacy compliance** - Users control their subscription level
- ‚úÖ **Secure payments** - Stripe handles all payment processing

- ‚úÖ **Support integration** - Easy escalation for billing issues

This subscription infrastructure provides a professional, user-friendly way to manage subscriptions while maximizing user retention and revenue potential. Users never lose access completely, making reactivation much more likely than requiring them to create entirely new accounts.
