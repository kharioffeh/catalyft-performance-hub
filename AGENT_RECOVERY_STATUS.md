# Agent Recovery Status

## 🔄 Recovery Summary
**Date**: $(date)
**Previous Agent Work**: E2E Testing Setup for CataLyft Performance Hub
**Recovery Action**: Successfully resumed and triggered E2E workflow

## ✅ What Was Already Completed
1. **Full E2E Test Suite** - Comprehensive tests in `mobile/e2e/flows.e2e.ts`
2. **GitHub Actions Workflow** - Complete CI/CD pipeline for iOS and Android
3. **Test Infrastructure** - Helper functions, smoke tests, Jest configuration
4. **Component Test IDs** - Added to all major UI components
5. **Documentation** - Complete guides for E2E testing

## 🚀 Actions Taken During Recovery
1. ✅ Analyzed the crashed agent's work and current project state
2. ✅ Validated E2E setup is complete and properly configured
3. ✅ Triggered new E2E workflow run by pushing to main branch
4. ✅ Commit: `65880345` - "🔄 Resume E2E testing after agent crash - trigger workflow"

## 📊 Current Status
- **GitHub Actions**: E2E workflow triggered and should be running now
- **Expected Duration**: 15-30 minutes (iOS: ~15min, Android: ~20min)
- **Monitor At**: https://github.com/kharioffeh/catalyft-performance-hub/actions

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Now)
1. **Monitor Workflow**: Check GitHub Actions for the running E2E tests
2. **Watch for Results**: Both iOS and Android jobs should complete

### If Tests Pass ✅
- E2E testing infrastructure is fully operational
- Can add more test scenarios as needed
- Ready for continuous testing on every push

### If Tests Fail ❌
1. Review the GitHub Actions logs for specific errors
2. Common issues to check:
   - iOS: Simulator availability, build scheme detection
   - Android: Emulator boot timeout, META-INF conflicts
   - Jest: Module resolution, TypeScript configuration

## 📝 Notes
- Running on Linux environment, so local iOS/Android testing not possible
- All E2E tests must run through GitHub Actions CI/CD
- The setup includes automatic retries and fallback mechanisms
